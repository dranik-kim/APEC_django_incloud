# APEC_django_incloud
## Welcome to our project!
This is a project we did during our django course at APEC PetroTechnic Higher College in 2025. We made a hotel booking website called InCloud.

## Our group consists of:
- Adelya Kalidullina
  - The motivator, the group engine. Basically the manager that checks up on every member to ensure they're working. Developed the website achitecture and made sure Tanya was on time.
- Asylai Tynys
  - The quiet executor, one of the designers and frontend developers. Deals well with work pressure and rarely misses deadlines.
- Lunara Bolat
  - The aesthetic, the other half of the frontend part of the project. Her input is usually very creative and innovative.
- Tatyana Kim
  - The lazy genius. No, really, she can do it... after Adelya pisses her off enough. Smart, but a huge procrastinator. Good with databases. Not good with deadlines.
